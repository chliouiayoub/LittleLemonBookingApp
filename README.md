# Little Lemon Booking Website

## Project Description
This project was developed as part of Meta's Front-End Development course on Coursera, serving as the capstone project for the Front-End Development Track.

The website demonstrates the implementation of a booking application on the Little Lemon website, built using React components to showcase proficiency in React for web development. Additionally, the project features API calls for data handling.

N.B : Please note that the only fully functional feature on the website, aside from the design, is the "Reserve a Table" functionality.
